# Smart Mirror

This is the source code for the prototype UI of my smart mirror project outlined in [this article](https://medium.com/@maxbraun/my-bathroom-mirror-is-smarter-than-yours-94b21c6671ba#.4exmyxt0w).

Simply import the whole project into [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html), then build and run the apk.

Note that in order to get the weather to show up you need to obtain an API key for the [Forecast API](https://developer.forecast.io) and add it to [`Weather.java`](https://github.com/maxbbraun/mirror/blob/master/app/src/main/java/net/maxbraun/mirror/Weather.java#L26).
